      <body> 
         Philodendron melanochrysum plants, also commonly known as black-gold philodendron, are a rare type of vining philodendron that have become popular as houseplants due to their gorgeous foliage.
            Their velvet leaves come in shades of dark green with brilliantly contrasted yellow veins and can get as large as 3-5 ft tall, 1-2 ft wide (indoors); 12 ft tall, 8 ft wide (outdoors). 
            One of the best climbing foliage plants for a conservatory, this type of philodendron has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 25 cm long, but in ideal conditions they can grow even longer. 
            Young plants have smaller, broader, copper-red leaves, but when established they are quite superb.
            Black gold philodendron, has been in cultivation (outside of South America since at least 1886, exhibited to Europeans via Veitch Nurseries by Messrs Veitch & Son.
            A mature P. Melanochrysum like the ones pictured about can be upwards of $1500. A single leaf cutting or propagation will be more afforadable starting at $50, however cuttings are even rarer to find.
            while these plants can be difficult to come across, they are surprisingly easy to care for once you finally have one in your possession.
